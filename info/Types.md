# Types 

## Goal

The Goal of the types is to have 3 distinct types, Reals, Strings and Booleans each which diferents caracteristics and operators.

## Reals

The Reals which are like in maths, all the numbers to -infinity to +infinity.

#### Operators

The operators of the Reals will be, skipping the basic operation (+, -, *, /) are:

- Modular: The residue of a divition
  - The symbol will be: %
  - It accepts two arguments
    - a: the divisor
    - b: the divider
  - It returns a real
  - Example c = a % b;
- To: The times a number will multiply
  - The symbol will be **
  - It accepts to arguments
    - a: the number will be multiplied n times
    - n: the times this number will be multiply
   - It returns a real
   - Example: c = a ** b;

###### Sqrt or root will not be included in the list but will be included in a math module
