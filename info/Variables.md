# Variables

## Goal

The variables will be like in the others programing languaje a space in memory.

The goal of this is to made them it the more like TypeScript

Constants in typescript
```ts
const hello: string = 'hello'
```

Varibles in typescript
```ts
let hello: string = 'hello'
```

## Creation of a variable

Like before this languaje should use a structure like this:

`let <name>: <type> = <value>;`



In this languaje all the lines should end with a ; like in C/C++.
